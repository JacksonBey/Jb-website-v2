                        <div class="endorsement">&#9;As the Technical Director at Overdose, I would personally like to recommend Jackson as a solid developer and team member. From the first day that Jackson came to work with us at Overdose, I keep being impressed with his unique and creative thinking in order to solve complex problems, as well as his code quality.
                        <br/>
                            In various instances we have referred to Jackson as our “Swiss Army Knife” on the team, because although we hired him primarily to be a React developer, he has volunteered to take on other interesting and challenging problems in other languages or platforms, and he always exceeds expectations. And for this reason, I have seen tremendous growth. He has gained additional skills and experience which will only make him a more efficient and effective problem solver whether that be in the tech industry or anywhere else that he decides to go!
                        <br/>
                            As a team member, Jackson has contributed greatly to our development process and positively to our team culture. He has learned and taught us a thing or two about improving our unit testing practices, and he has participated in hackathons and other tech events, both at work and outside of work to keep his skills sharp and to be future focused. All around Jackson is just a great guy!</div>

                        <div class="endorsement">&#9;Jackson really impressed me in the short time we worked together. He was always coming up with new ideas and solutions to make work better and more efficient. He introduced unit testing to the team and that’s made QA a much easier process and greatly reduced the overall number of bugs. 
                            <br/>
                            Jackson is also great at presenting work to clients. He’s wonderful at fielding questions and explaining things in a way that non-technical people can easily understand. 
                            <br/>
                            I’m so happy that I got to work with Jackson. He’s a terrific developer and I foresee an exciting career ahead of him. </div>

                            He never had an issue communicating with teammates and created an atmosphere that was positive for everyone to share their thoughts and ideas.</div>

                        <div class="endorsement">&#9;Jackson is someone I’ve known for a long time. We went to high school together, although we weren’t terribly close until we lived together during his time at Whatcom Community College. 
                            <br/>
                            After Jackson graduated from UW and struggled to find work in his field of study, I recommended that he attend Flatiron School and become a software engineer. He listened and proceeded to excel in the field. I’m happy to say that he has now surpassed me in programming ability. 
                            <br/>
                            Jackson is a great programmer and an all around good guy. If he comes up for grabs, you should hire him. I wish I could have him on my team at work. </div>
